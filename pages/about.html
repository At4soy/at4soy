          Ahmet, it's Ahmet. I am a car enthusiast and IT student living in
          Turkey. I am in the 12th grade in high school and I will start my
          internship at the end of the summer. I have been interested in
          software for 4 years and I strive to make it a profession. I never
          give up, I have started a lot of start-ups but they did not turn out
          well. I am still trying to start a start-up and I will not let it go.

        <h1>I get started in software?</h1>
        <p>
          I was 12 years old when I first started coding in my life. I saw a
          video about making Discord bots while I was hanging out in Discord and
          I liked it very much. I started making bots using NodeJS and Atom as
          much as I learned from the videos. During this time, I was going to
          high school. I preferred an informatics high school because I thought
          coding was enjoyable and I thought I could be successful. I started my
          high school in HHY, which is the best informatics high school in
          Turkey, in the 9th grade, Python, algorithms, hardware, etc. I had
          learned things but they did not pass my interest. So I was progressing
          through NodeJS on my own. When I switched to 10th grade, I started
          learning Arduino and C# .NET Form with C++. C# fascinated me. Although
          Arduino never interested me, I focused on C#. I tried to make games on
          the form, I worked very often, I wrote code for days and tried to be
          the most successful in the course. During this time, it was time to
          take a project assignment and I chose the C# course. We were asked to
          make a game as a project assignment. Everyone was making games on the
          form such as Flappy Bird by looking on YouTube, but I wanted to do
          something different and unique. It had to be something that the
          teachers would not forget throughout the whole school. As a result of
          my research, I came across Unity. I learnt that Unity, which I saw in
          games when I was little, was a game engine. I started watching a lot
          of tutorials on YouTube and started making my first game. Meanwhile, I
          bought a new computer in 10th grade because my computer could not
          handle C#. I started working in Unity without any problems. As far as
          I learned on YouTube, I was making a 2D war game, but this was not
          learning, but doing it by heart. I couldn't fix any errors. Meanwhile,
          Chat GPT had emerged, which was tremendous news for me. I was starting
          to figure out my mistakes, but I couldn't make the adjustments I
          wanted because I was just working by rote. The training on Udemy was
          beyond my budget, so I looked at the forums. After I started learning,
          I turned to foreign resources on YouTube. I was seriously starting to
          learn and progress. I was making my own MMORPG game, I wasn't going to
          school for this game, I was missing classes. After months of game
          development, I received full marks when I submitted it. As a result,
          my professors introduced me to a software professor. He invited me to
          Teknofest. But I had no interest in robotics. After the game I made,
          summer vacation started, I started to improve myself during the summer
          vacation, and during this time, I decided to establish a game company
          with my friends. But after knowing the difficulties, expenses and
          other work, it remained just a dream. My interest in the game
          development industry had diminished. I was out of town on summer
          vacation and had an old laptop. As long as there was internet, I
          started watching HTML5 and CSS3 courses on YouTube and turned to web
          design. When the holiday ended, I was in the 11th grade. When I looked
          at the courses, there were web design, mobile applications and graphic
          design. I progressed very well in the first weeks on the web because I
          learned a lot of things during the summer vacation. But the database
          finally forced me. I wanted to improve myself more, so I took a
          project from the mobile course and started making a mobile application
          with Flutter. While I wanted to learn more about designs, I turned to
          Figma. Apart from this, I learned Photoshop, After Effects and Adobe
          Animate in the graphics course. But among all these, it was the
          websites that caught my attention the most. I wanted to improve myself
          a lot. I was drawn to a lot of things like JS, Bootstrap, .NET,
          Microsoft SQL. But I didn't enjoy developing sites with .NET at all.
          During this time, I was finishing my year as the most successful IT
          student at school. I was in 12th grade and needed to find an
          internship. Because I was successful, my professors directed me
          somewhere, and as a result of the interviews, they asked me to learn
          PHP, Laravel and Tailwind. At that time, I thought PHP was a language
          used only for old sites, but it was not like that at all. I have now
          started developing sites with PHP, Laravel and MySQL.
