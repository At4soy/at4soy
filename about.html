      <p>Ahmet, it's Ahmet. I am a car enthusiast and IT student living in Turkey. I am in the 12th grade in high school and I will start my internship at the end of the summer. I have been interested in software for 4 years and I strive to make it a profession. I never give up, I have started a lot of start-ups but they did not turn out well. I am still trying to start a start-up and I will not let it go.</p>

      <h1>I get started in software?</h1>
      <p>I was 12 years old when I first started coding in my life. I saw a video about making Discord bots while I was hanging out in Discord and I liked it very much. I started making bots using NodeJS and Atom as much as I learned from the videos. During this time, I was going to high school. I preferred an informatics high school because I thought coding was enjoyable and I thought I could be successful. I started my high school in HHY, which is the best informatics high school in Turkey, in the 9th grade, Python, algorithms, hardware, etc. I had learned things but they did not pass my interest. So I was progressing through NodeJS on my own. When I switched to 10th grade, I started learning Arduino and C# .NET Form with C++. C# fascinated me. Although Arduino never interested me, I focused on C#. I tried to make games on the form, I worked very often, I wrote code for days and tried to be the most successful in the course. During this time, it was time to take a project assignment and I chose the C# course. We were asked to make a game as a project assignment. Everyone was making games on the form such as Flappy Bird by looking on YouTube, but I wanted to do something different and unique. It had to be something that the teachers would not forget throughout the whole school. As a result of my research, I came across Unity. I learnt that Unity, which I saw in games when I was little, was a game engine. I started watching a lot of tutorials on YouTube and started making my first game. Meanwhile, I bought a new computer in 10th grade because my computer could not handle C#. I started working in Unity without any problems. As far as I learned on YouTube, I was making a 2D war game, but this was not learning, but doing it by heart. I couldn't fix any errors. Meanwhile, Chat GPT had emerged, which was tremendous news for me. I was starting to figure out my mistakes, but I couldn't make the adjustments I wanted because I was just working by rote. The training on Udemy was beyond my budget, so I looked at the forums. After I started learning, I turned to foreign resources on YouTube. I was seriously starting to learn and progress. I was making my own MMORPG game, I wasn't going to school for this game, I was missing classes. After months of game development, I received full marks when I submitted it. As a result, my professors introduced me to a software professor. He invited me to Teknofest. But I had no interest in robotics. After the game I made, summer vacation started, I started to improve myself during the summer vacation, and during this time, I decided to establish a game company with my friends. But after knowing the difficulties, expenses and other work, it remained just a dream. My interest in the game development industry had diminished. I was out of town on summer vacation and had an old laptop. As long as there was internet, I started watching HTML5 and CSS3 courses on YouTube and turned to web design. When the holiday ended, I was in the 11th grade. When I looked at the courses, there were web design, mobile applications and graphic design. I progressed very well in the first weeks on the web because I learned a lot of things during the summer vacation. But the database finally forced me. I wanted to improve myself more, so I took a project from the mobile course and started making a mobile application with Flutter. While I wanted to learn more about designs, I turned to Figma. Apart from this, I learned Photoshop, After Effects and Adobe Animate in the graphics course. But among all these, it was the websites that caught my attention the most. I wanted to improve myself a lot. I was drawn to a lot of things like JS, Bootstrap, .NET, Microsoft SQL. But I didn't enjoy developing sites with .NET at all. During this time, I was finishing my year as the most successful IT student at school. I was in 12th grade and needed to find an internship. Because I was successful, my professors directed me somewhere, and as a result of the interviews, they asked me to learn PHP, Laravel and Tailwind. At that time, I thought PHP was a language used only for old sites, but it was not like that at all. I have now started developing sites with PHP, Laravel and MySQL.</p>
